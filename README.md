# Excel Project: Investment Portfolio Analysis

## Context

This task involved analyzing the investment strategies of Jackson, a recent actuarial graduate, who aimed to save for a home deposit over a 10-year period. The project required the use of Excel to model and simulate various investment scenarios based on Jackson's salary, savings, and investment options.

## Project Overview

The project was divided into several tasks, focusing on Jackson's income, investment strategies, and risk analysis. The main components included:

1. **Performance Bonus Calculation:** Calculated the probabilities that Jackson's total performance bonus would be no less than $90,000 and no more than $10,000.
2. **Income and Investment Table:** Created a detailed table showing Jackson's monthly income (base salary and bonuses) and the corresponding investment amounts over the 10-year period.
3. **Portfolio Optimization:** Calculated the expected returns and standard deviations for Jackson's technology portfolio (AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, and later NVDA) and determined the optimal portfolio weights using historical data from Yahoo Finance.
4. **Simulation of Investment Returns:** Simulated 100 trajectories of the portfolio's monthly returns over the 10-year period, assuming normally distributed returns.
5. **VAS Log Return Analysis:** Calculated the monthly log returns for the Vanguard Australian Shares Index Fund (VAS) using historical data and simulated 100 trajectories of its monthly log returns.
6. **Accumulated Value Calculation:** Simulated the accumulated values for three investment options (technology portfolio, corporate bonds with VAS, and risky asset Y) and compared their performance using histograms and summary statistics.
7. **Recommendation:** Provided a brief recommendation to Jackson based on the analysis, summarizing the findings and suggesting the best investment strategy.
8. **Limitations and Improvements:** Discussed the limitations of the analysis and proposed potential improvements.

## Data and Tools

- **Data Sources:** Historical monthly adjusted close prices for AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, and VAS.AX from Yahoo Finance (January 2019 to January 2024).
- **Tools:** Excel was used for all calculations, simulations, and visualizations.
